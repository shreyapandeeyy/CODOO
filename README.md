*Watch how LitCode brings competitive programming to life! See real-time battles between coders competing to solve algorithmic challenges.*

## üéÆ How It Works

1. Queue up for a match by selecting your preferred problem category:
   - Graph Problems
   - Tree Traversals
   - Array Manipulations
   - And more!

2. Get matched with another player in your skill range
3. Race to solve the coding challenge
4. First person to pass all test cases wins!

## üìù Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later) or yarn
- Python (v3.8 or later)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- RapidAPI account for Judge0 API key

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyapandeeyy/CODOO.git
   cd CODOO
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # For the frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

   # For the backend
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of both frontend and backend.
   - Use the provided `.env.example` file as a template.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Start the frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev

   # Start the backend
   cd ../backend
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.
   - The backend server should be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your `.env` files:

#### Frontend `.env` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_MONGO_DB_KEY=your_mongo_db_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret
```

#### Backend `.env` file:
```
JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_judge0_api_key
MONGO_DB_KEY=your_mongo_db_key
SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret
```
