# LitCode üî•

LitCode is a competitive 1v1 coding platform where developers can challenge each other to solve algorithmic problems in real-time. Think of it as a multiplayer version of LeetCode where you can directly compete against other programmers!


## üì∫ Quick Demo

*Watch how LitCode brings competitive programming to life! See real-time battles between coders competing to solve algorithmic challenges.*

## üéÆ How It Works

1. Queue up for a match by selecting your preferred problem category:
   - Graph Problems
   - Tree Traversals
   - Array Manipulations
   - And more!

2. Get matched with another player in your skill range
3. Race to solve the coding challenge
4. First person to pass all test cases wins!
